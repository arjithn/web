I have always wanted to have personal website built with a blog... But never really got started at it. So what changed now?

A while ago, I saw a tweet from Hassan Abudu [(@hassanabudu)](https://twitter.com/hassanabudu), who was looking to get started with the #100DaysOfGatsby Challenge. Me being someone who spends a lot of time around JS (world's best programming lang) , I was naturally into JAMStack, Headless CMS and Gatsby too! All I ever did was to point him towards the right resources for him to begin...

<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don&#39;t wait for the newsletter. <br>You can follow along these guided challenges in the docs.<a href="https://t.co/U1JoVthHcp">https://t.co/U1JoVthHcp</a><br>You have a link at the bottom of the page which takes you to the next challenge.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysofGatsby</a></p>&mdash; Arjith (@arjithn) <a href="https://twitter.com/arjithn/status/1281340234530033664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And it was such a sweet gesture when he mentioned me in [his tweet & first ever blog post](https://blue-binder.surge.sh/hello-world/). So much for such a simple act!

I have always wondered like do my opinions matter, I'm not an expert myself in anything, who would ever listen to me ? There are already a lot of folks who were better than me. Why should I start blogging in tech?... Then it hit me :

> **Regardless of your experience, expertise level, you can always help each other out. And this changed everything.**

So yeah that's story of how I got back my motivation to set this site up and start writing. Thanks to Hassan! It's kind of like the [bootstrap paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop) so as to "who made who start the blog" between me and him.

Well, I'm not committing to #100DaysOfGatsby at this point, cos I knw it will be difficult to do with my current work schedule. But I will updating the site and blog with articles pretty regularly
